# Image Obfuscation Tool

A lightweight Python utility for protecting privacy in images through noise addition and blurring. This tool is designed for quick and easy obfuscation of sensitive information in images.

## üåü Features

- üîí **EXIF Data Removal** - Strip potentially sensitive metadata from images
- üå´ **Noise Addition** - Add customizable random noise to obscure details
- üñºÔ∏è **Batch Processing** - Process entire directories

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-obfuscator.git
   cd image-obfuscator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Add noise to images
python obfuscate_images.py input/ output/ --noise --noise_strength 30

# Apply blur
python obfuscate_images.py input/ output/ --blur --blur_radius 3

# Combine both effects
python obfuscate_images.py input/ output/ --noise --blur
```

### Parameters

- `input`: Path to input file or directory
- `output`: Output directory
- `--noise`: Add random noise
- `--blur`: Apply Gaussian blur
- `--noise_strength`: Intensity of noise (default: 20)
- `--blur_radius`: Blur radius (default: 2)

## Comparison with Other Tools

### vs Fawkes

| Feature | This Tool | Fawkes |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Purpose | General image obfuscation | Face protection against facial recognition |
| Method | Noise, blur, EXIF removal | Neural network-based cloaking |
| Speed | Very fast | Slower (neural network processing) |
| Ease of Use | Simple CLI | Requires more setup |
| Protection | Visual obfuscation | AI-targeted protection |
| Best For | Quick privacy protection, batch processing | Strong protection against facial recognition |

### When to Use This Tool
- Quick obfuscation of sensitive information
- Batch processing multiple images
- When you need simple, explainable obfuscation

### When to Consider Fawkes
- Specifically protecting against facial recognition
- Need stronger AI-targeted protection
- Willing to trade speed for stronger protection
